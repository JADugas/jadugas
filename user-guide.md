## About me

Hello there! :wave: I'm Jesse Dugas (/jeh-see due-gah/, he/him), a seasoned accessibility and user experience professional with over a decade in the digital workspace. Currently, I'm a Senior Accessibility Program Manager at GitHub. My background spans user experience design, user research, and front-end development for web and apps. I've applied my skills at companies like TikTok, Boston Scientific, and various startups, always focusing on creating inclusive and user-friendly digital experiences.

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

- No matter how nerdy you think I might be, I'm sure I'm nerdier.
- I'm a media reference machine, often quoting movies, TV shows, books and song lyrics in conversation.

### What drives you nuts?

- Dishonesty.
- People that intentionally put down others.

### What are your quirks?

- I love to collaborate, I tend to make decisions based on empathy and data of surveyed people to ensure I'm viewing the full picture.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

- I can appear very serious or intense, but really I'm just monotone and absorbing information.
- I have a genuine interest in people, their stories and passions, I often look to talk beyond the surface level.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?

- Clear and direct communication. If you explain the what and the why, I'm not going to take it personally.

### What do you wish colleagues didn't do?

- I wish colleagues wouldn't dance around problems. If there's an issue with the project, you didn't have enough time, you don't like my idea, just say it and we can work through a solution together!

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

- I love it when people build others on their team up. We have a wealth of knowledge and talent here and it's great to see people recognize that and promote it.
- I love when people take ownership of their work and are proud of what they've accomplished or recognize their hypothesis didn't go the way they expected, it shows real growth and passion to me.

## About my interactions

### What's the best way to communicate with you?

- I don't check my email often, a Slack message if a short answer is needed, or a quick Zoom call if you have a discussion or more than one question is usually best for me.

### What's the best way to convince you to do something?

- Make your case! Data can help me a lot, especially when it comes to user feedback. If you can show me that a change will make a positive impact on users, I'm all in.
- Have a discussion with me. I tend to get closed off if I am told to do something without explanation.

### How do you like to give feedback?

- I'm happy to give feedback in just about any format someone prefers it.
- I typically like the feedback to be a dialogue rather than a one-way conversation. I want to understand your perspective and I want you to understand mine.
- I like to provide feedback in a solo setting, I don't like to call people out in front of others. I think it's important to have a conversation with the person and not about the person.

### How do you like to get feedback?

- Typically I like to get feedback in a one-on-one setting. I like to understand the context and the why behind the feedback and it's easier for me to discern tone and intent compared to writing.
